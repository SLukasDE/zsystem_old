Define the target that you want to build the library for.
Type 'export BUILD_TARGET=x86' if you want to build the library for a 32bit system.
Type 'export BUILD_TARGET=x64' if you want to build the library for a 64bit system.

Now you can build the library with 'make' or 'make all'.
And you can install the library and its header files with 'make install'. Maybe you need to be root for doing that.
